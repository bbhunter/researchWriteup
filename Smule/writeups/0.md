`redirection_url=` parameter at [https://www.smule.com/user/login?redirection_url=](https://www.smule.com/user/login?redirection_url=) was vulnerable to Open redirect.

## Proof of Concept
### Open redirect bypass
Open redirect bypass payload used: `///google.com`
 * [https://www.smule.com/user/login?redirection_url=////google.com](https://www.smule.com/user/login?redirection_url=////google.com)

#### Issue was reported to Smule via Support and they agreed to disclose it on HackerOne.
